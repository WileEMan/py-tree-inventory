# tree_inventory
The tree_inventory Python program/package provides a means of calculate a checksum for a directory tree.  The checksum is stored in a .json file at the root of the tree and contains checksum information for each directory in the tree as well as a checksum of all file contents within each directory.  Each filename is part of the checksum process, such that adding, removing, or renaming a file is sufficient to flag a difference between two copies of the tree.  The tree_inventory program includes a comparison tool that can quickly show differences between two similar trees after having the checksum calculated on each.  An update-copy functionality is also provided.

The tree_inventory provides a command-line interface.  For information, use --help.  The package provides a number of functions that are similar to the CLI options provided.
